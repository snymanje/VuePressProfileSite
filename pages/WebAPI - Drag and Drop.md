# HTML Drag and Drop Example
<br>
<hr>
<br>

***HTML Drag and Drop*** interfaces enable applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. The user may select draggable elements with a mouse, drag those elements to a droppable element, and drop them by releasing the mouse button.  

HTML drag-and-drop uses the ***DOM event model*** and ***drag events*** inherited from ***mouse events***. A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, drags the element to a droppable element, and then releases the dragged element.  

During the drag operations, several event types are fired, and some events might fire many times, such as the ***drag*** and ***dragover*** events. 
<br> 

### The Drag Events
From the source element,
* dragstart
* drag
* dragend
  
<br>

On the target element,
* dragenter
* dragover
* dragleave
* dragexit
* drop

<br>

***Note that dragstart and dragend events are not fired when dragging a file into the browser from the OS.***
<br>

## Step 1 - Make Element Draggable
First you need to add the ***draggable attribute*** to the html element and set it to true.
Then in the javascript we need to add a ***event listener*** to the draggable element to listen for the ***dragstart*** event.

```html
<div class="movingElements">
    <div class="box">
        <img
          src="http://source.unsplash.com/random/150x150"
          draggable="true"
          ...
          />
        </div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```
<br>

Every event related to drag and drop comes is a DragEvent object, and it comes with a property called ***dataTransfer*** which holds the data being dragged.  
So in the ***dragstart*** event we need to use the ***dataTransfer*** property to specify that data we are moving.
```javascript
const sourcElement = document.querySelector(".image");

sourcElement.addEventListener("dragstart", dragstart);

function dragstart(e) {
  e.dataTransfer.setData("text", e.target.id);
}

```
<br>
<br>

## Step 2 - The Drop Target
Where can we drag elements to is the next thing we need to specify. As well as we canâ€™t just drag and drop any element, the element must be valid drop target.  
To make an element a drop target you need to listen to atleast the ***dragover*** and ***drop*** events.  
For the ***dragover*** event we only prevent the defaults.  

For the ***drag*** event we get the data for the source (moving element) and then append it to the target element.
```javascript
const targetElement = document.querySelectorAll(".box");

targetElement.forEach(el => {
  el.addEventListener("dragover", dragOver);
  el.addEventListener("drop", dragDrop);
});

function dragOver(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
}

function dragDrop(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = e.dataTransfer.getData("text");
  e.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
}
```
***Note that each handler calls preventDefault() to prevent additional event processing for this event (such as touch events or pointer events).***
