# HTML Drag and Drop Example

<br>
<hr>
<br>

**_HTML Drag and Drop_** interfaces enable applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. The user may select draggable elements with a mouse, drag those elements to a droppable element, and drop them by releasing the mouse button.

HTML drag-and-drop uses the **_DOM event model_** and **_drag events_** inherited from **_mouse events_**. A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, drags the element to a droppable element, and then releases the dragged element.

During the drag operations, several event types are fired, and some events might fire many times, such as the **_drag_** and **_dragover_** events.
<br>

### The Drag Events

From the source element,

- dragstart
- drag
- dragend

<br>

On the target element,

- dragenter
- dragover
- dragleave
- dragexit
- drop

<br>

**_Note that dragstart and dragend events are not fired when dragging a file into the browser from the OS._**
<br>

## Exmaple 1 - with drag and drop from local file system.

## Step 1 - Make Element Draggable

First you need to add the **_draggable attribute_** to the html element and set it to true.
Then in the javascript we need to add a **_event listener_** to the draggable element to listen for the **_dragstart_** event.

```html
<div class="movingElements">
  <div class="box">
    <img src="http://source.unsplash.com/random/150x150" draggable="true" ... />
  </div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

<br>

Every event related to drag and drop comes is a DragEvent object, and it comes with a property called **_dataTransfer_** which holds the data being dragged.  
So in the **_dragstart_** event we need to use the **_dataTransfer_** property to specify that data we are moving.

```javascript
const sourcElement = document.querySelector(".image");

sourcElement.addEventListener("dragstart", dragstart);

function dragstart(e) {
  e.dataTransfer.setData("text", e.target.id);
}
```

<br>
<br>

## Step 2 - The Drop Target

Where can we drag elements to is the next thing we need to specify. As well as we canâ€™t just drag and drop any element, the element must be valid drop target.  
To make an element a drop target you need to listen to atleast the **_dragover_** and **_drop_** events.  
For the **_dragover_** event we only prevent the defaults.

For the **_drag_** event we get the data for the source (moving element) and then append it to the target element.

```javascript
const targetElement = document.querySelectorAll(".box");

targetElement.forEach((el) => {
  el.addEventListener("dragover", dragOver);
  el.addEventListener("drop", dragDrop);
});

function dragOver(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
}

function dragDrop(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = e.dataTransfer.getData("text");
  e.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
}
```

**_Note that each handler calls preventDefault() to prevent additional event processing for this event (such as touch events or pointer events)._**
