# HTML Drag and Drop Example

<br>
<hr>
<br>

**_HTML Drag and Drop_** interfaces enable applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. The user may select draggable elements with a mouse, drag those elements to a droppable element, and drop them by releasing the mouse button.

HTML drag-and-drop uses the **_DOM event model_** and **_drag events_** inherited from **_mouse events_**. A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, drags the element to a droppable element, and then releases the dragged element.

During the drag operations, several event types are fired, and some events might fire many times, such as the **_drag_** and **_dragover_** events.
<br>

### The Drag Events

From the source element,

- dragstart
- drag
- dragend

<br>

On the target element,

- dragenter
- dragover
- dragleave
- dragexit
- drop

<br>

**_Note that dragstart and dragend events are not fired when dragging a file into the browser from the OS._**
<br>

## Exmaple 1 - with drag and drop from local file system.

## Step 1 - Make Element Draggable

First you need to add the **_draggable attribute_** to the html element and set it to true.
Then in the javascript we need to add a **_event listener_** to the draggable element to listen for the **_dragstart_** event.

```html
<div class="movingElements">
  <div class="box">
    <img src="http://source.unsplash.com/random/150x150" draggable="true" ... />
  </div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

<br>

Every event related to drag and drop comes is a DragEvent object, and it comes with a property called **_dataTransfer_** which holds the data being dragged.  
So in the **_dragstart_** event we need to use the **_dataTransfer_** property to specify that data we are moving.

```javascript
const sourcElement = document.querySelector(".image");

sourcElement.addEventListener("dragstart", dragstart);

function dragstart(e) {
  e.dataTransfer.setData("text", e.target.id);
}
```

<br>
<br>

## Step 2 - The Drop Target

Where can we drag elements to is the next thing we need to specify. As well as we can’t just drag and drop any element, the element must be valid drop target.  
To make an element a drop target you need to listen to atleast the **_dragover_** and **_drop_** events.  
For the **_dragover_** event we only prevent the defaults.

For the **_drag_** event we get the data for the source (moving element) and then append it to the target element.

```javascript
const targetElement = document.querySelectorAll(".box");

targetElement.forEach((el) => {
  el.addEventListener("dragover", dragOver);
  el.addEventListener("drop", dragDrop);
});

function dragOver(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
}

function dragDrop(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = e.dataTransfer.getData("text");
  e.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
}
```

**_Note that each handler calls preventDefault() to prevent additional event processing for this event (such as touch events or pointer events)._**
